# Internship Summary
## Day-1 (28/02/25)
### <ins>Key Learnings of the Day:
Today is the first day of the internship, new place new beginning and I am very much thrilled for the upcoming days in the internship. Today I have gained more knowledge about skills and what are the types of skills, also about team player.

There are four types of skill set: horizontal skill set, vertical skill set, T-shaped skill set, inverted triangle skill set. The one with horizontal skill set is said to be specialized in a single skill, whereas the one with vertical skill set is said to have basic knowledge about multiple skills but doesn’t have deep knowledge about any of them. The one with T-shaped skill set is said to have knowledge in multiple skills but specialized in a single skill. The one with inverted triangle skill set is said to have a core skill and also multiple skills that supports the core skill. In my point of view inverted triangle skill set is the best as it has multiple skills that supports a single core skill and the triangle keeps getting bigger when new skills are added.

The common skills of a programmer are reading, writing, learning, communication, problem solving, mathematical thinking and googling or research. These are some of the skills that a programmer must have. In the upcoming days I should be able to obtain all of these skills.
	

### Problem Solving:
Problem solving skill is not only for the programming but also for everyday life. Problem solving means to find a solution for the problem and ignoring the problem is not a solution for that. There are few steps in problem solving.
- Don’t avoid the problem – As I have mentioned above ignoring a problem is never a solution, so instead of avoiding a problem try solving it in a better way.
- Understand the problem – This means analyse the problem, think about it again and again which can have a solution hidden in it.
- Find constraints – This means to identify the rules and limitations that I have to go through to solve a problem.
- Solve the problem 

#### Team Player:
Team player is the one who works well with others, understands others feelings, communicate effectively to achieve a common goal. There are three types of people in an organization: Humble, Hungry and Smart.

People who are humble works in an organization without aiming any growth n their work. They care about others feelings, understands others, communicates well with everyone but doesn’t see themselves in a growing path.

People who are hungry works in an organization only aiming in their growth. They usually don’t care about how others feel and only care about them being successful.

People who are smart works in an organization with the aim of self-growth as well as the team-growth. They understand others feelings, communicates well with others and also work hard on their self-growth.

We also had a discussion on “how we calm our mind?” Everyone shared their thoughts on that. I have also gained some basic knowledge about Git. Git is very much useful if you want to revert to previous versions if needed. Using git multiple developers can work on the same project without any conflicts.
