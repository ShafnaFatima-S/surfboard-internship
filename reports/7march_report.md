# Internship Summary
## Day-6 (07/03/25)
### <ins> Key learnings of the day:</ins>
Today we started the session by recalling whatever happened yesterday. We were talking about programming language and who needs programming language. In english language symbols can be from a-z, A-Z,0-9 and special characters like !, @, #, $ and many more. Token types can be noun, pronoun, adverb, adjectives. Expressions can be sentences, statements, article. Group of expression can be paragraph, book, section. By tokenizer we split the text into small words called tokens. By syntax analysis we check whether the sentence is formed based on the rules and check for semantics. Semantics describes the meaning behind the rules. Then code is generated using machine level language.

### Math functions
The Math.floor() method is used return the value rounded down to the nearest integer. The Math.round() method is used to return the value to the nearest integer. The Math.ceil() method is used to return the value up to the nearest integer The Math.random() method is used to get any random number between 0 and 1.

The JSON.parse() is used to convert a string to JSON. The JSON.stringify() method is used to convert JSON object to JSON string. The parseFloat() method is used to convert a string to floating point number. The parseInt() method is used to convert a string to a number. Promise is an object that acts as a placeholder for the result. A promise is created using the new promise constructor, which takes two parameters: resolve and reject.

The promise.all() method is used to resolve when all the promise resolves and rejects if any fails.The promise.allsettled() method is used to return the result of all promises whether resolved or rejected. The Async keyword ensures that the execution is not blocked. Async functions always return a promise. The await keyword is used to wait for a promise to resolve. It can only be used within an async . Await makes the code wait until the promise returns a result.

The then() method in JavaScript is used with promises to handle asynchronous operations. It accepts two callback functions: one for handling a promiseâ€™s resolved value and one for handling its rejection. The catch() method is called whenever a promise is rejected.This method is used for error handling. This method is used after .then

I have also solved a problem for returning a normal statement into camelcase. First I had split the sentence using split() method and then made the first word into lowercase. Then I sliced the first letter of the remaning words and turned it into uppercase. Then I concatenated everything to turn it into camelcase. 

Callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function. Callback function works after another function is finished.The setTimeout() takes the callback function as argument and executes it after the specified time. The setTimeout() method takes two arguments: the callback function and the time delay. Along with that we can give arguments for the callback function is necessary. I also googled how internet works. It works by connecting multiple routers together.

I also googled about what URL is. The URL has many parts like scheme, domain, port, path. The scheme is a part of URL which indicates what protocol the browser must use to request a resource. For websites it uses http or https protocol. HTTPS protocol is used for secured transaction.The domain indicates which Web server is being requested. The path represents the path to the resource on the Web server. 

Camel case is represented by using lowercase for the first word and capitalize the first letter of the second word. Snake case is naming with words separated by underscore and all small letters. Kebab case is naming with words separated by hyphen and all small letters. Pascal case is naming with first letter of each word is capitalized. Macro case is naming with all letters capitalized but the words are joined with underscore. Train case is naming with first character of every word of name is Capitalised and words are connected with hyphen.
