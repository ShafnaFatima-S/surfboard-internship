### <ins> Key learnings of the day:</ins>
Today we had a session about savings and investments. Savings and investment both help us have some money for the future but the main difference is that savings do not grow and investments can grow. We discussed about the savings and investment ideas like fixed deposit, stocks, gold savings, mutual funds. We also discussed about some of the best investors around the world and few books that could help anyone to have idea about investments like financial shenanigans.

We discussed about how we should buy a stock. Before investing in stock we should know about the company that we are investing. We should be well aware of how the company generates revenue, what the company does, how much profit they get, how many stocks they hold. We should always look into the P/E ratio before buying stocks. The P/E ratio means price to earnings ratio. The P/E ratio helps us find and evaluate the company's stock.

Investing in gold is one of the best way to have savings. Even during inflations the gold still has its value or sometimes increase in value. When the value of the currency decreases the value of the gold will be increasing. They are inversely proportional to each other. When investing in mutual funds we should analyze what type of fund it is and how it works. We should not invest without knowing how it will work and the benefits you get from that. When you are going for fixed deposit always make sure that you compare the interest rates. Make sure that you are aware of the tenure. Whatever investments it might be always research and analyze about it. Do not invest in something just because someone asked you to do. Do it when you know completely about how your investments are going to increase. Investing as early as possible will make you grow faster.

Angular is a framework for developing client side applications using html, css and javascript. Angular is a open source framework developed and maintained by google. Angular uses components based architecture. Components are small pieces of code that can be easily reused whenever needed. Each component has a html file, css file, ts file. I started working in angular today. I installed angular using the command " npm install -g @angular/cli@17 ". Then I created a new app by using the command " ng new my-app ". Here my-app is the name of the app that you are going to create. To run the angular project I used the command " ng serve --open ".

I created separate components so that my app can be modified easily and understood easily. For creating a new component I used the command " ng g c component-name ". I have already created a design for my note app using figma. Now I am trying to design the note app using html and css using angular.
