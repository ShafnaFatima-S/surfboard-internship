Today we were discussing about programming language. Computer can only understand binary language that is 0's and 1's. Programming language is a way to communicate to machine. Programming language consists of set of rules, syntax, semantics.High level languages are human readable for example, python, java. Low level languages are machine readable language with symbolic representations.A compiler is used to translate high level language(python, java) into machine language(binary language).In english language group of alphabets make words, group of words make sentences, group of sentences make paragraph. Similarly symbols are alphabets, numbers and special characters, group of symbols make tokens, group of tokens make expression.

### String Methods:
The at() method returns the character in the specified index position.charCodeAt() method returns the code for that index position. The charAt() method returns the character in the specified index.The slice() method is used to extract a part of the string. The substring() method is also used to extract a part of the string.The substr() method is similar to slice() but the second parameter is the length to be sliced.

The toUpperCase() method is used to convert the string to uppercase. The toLowerCase() method is used to convert the string to lowercase. The concat() method is used to join two or more strings. The trim() method is used to remove the whitespaces on both the sides of the string. The trimStart() is used to remove whitespace on the starting of the string. The trimEnd() is used to remove whitespaces on the end of the string. The trimStart() is used to remove whitespace on the starting of string. The trimEnd() is used to remove whitespaces on the end of the string.

The padStart() method is used to fill a string to another string until it reaches a given length. The toString() method is used to convert to string. The padEnd() method is used to fill a string at the end of another string. The repeat() method is used to create copies of a string. The replace() method is used to replace a specified value with another string. It takes two parameter. The first one is the original word and the next one is the string to be replaced with. The replaceAll() method is used to replace a string with another string wherever the original string is used. The split() method is used to convert a string into array.

I was given a task to write an algorithm for the following question." Add different balls to a box, balls should be of different colours, every ball that has blue colour should be moved to a different box, and green colour balls should be painted pink and moved to a different box ". I wrote algorithm for this and I was asked to write code for this particular question. I had a basic idea but I couldn't implement it well enough in the code. I should definitely practice on that. I also had find solution to count the letters of a string. For that I had to split the string using the split operator and then using length method I counted the letters of that string. I have also learned what object means. 
 
Object is a data structure that stores related data in key value pair.The object.keys() method is used to get all the key data from the object. The object.values() method is used to get all the value data from the object.The = operator is used for assigning a value. The == operator is used to compare whether both the values are equal. The === operator is used to compare whether both the values are equal and strictly of the same type. The != operator is used to check whether the value is not equal to or not. The !== operator is used to check whether the value is not equal and strictly not of the same type.
