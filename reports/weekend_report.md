# Internship Weekend Summary
## 17/03/25 - 21/03/25
### <ins> Key learnings of the week:</ins>
This week I had learned about many things. I created a note app with functions to create a new note , get all the notes, display the note by id, update the note by using the id, remove the note when the delete function is triggered. The deleted data will not be actually deleted but when the user tries to view all the notes the deleted note will not be listed. I have made database connection using typeorm and postgreSQL.

PostgreSQL is a open source database system. Nestjs is a framework for building efficient and scalable server side and client side application. It is built with typescript but we can also use javascript. Nestjs uses frameworks like express. Typescript is the superset of javascript that adds types and many other features to improve the performance. Typescript complies down to javascript so it can run anywhere javascript runs. The primitive types are integer, string and boolean. The complex data types are derived from the primitive data types. The complex data types are array, object and map.

I installed nestjs using " npm i -g @nestjs/cli " and to start a new project use the " nest new project-name " command. The difference between node.js and nest.js is that node.js uses the javascript and nest.js uses typescript. Nest.js is structured and modular compared to node.js. I connected to the database with typeorm. Then I gave all the essential details like username, password, type, host, port, database, entities and synchronize.

The type defines what kind of database we are connecting to. The host refers where the database is located. For now we are using localhost as I am running the application and the database in the same system. The username refers to the username to authenticate the connection to the database. The password refers to the specific password for the username field.The port refers to the port number that we are using to connect to the database.The synchronize tells the typeorm to automatically synchronize the database schema with the models. The entities represents the table in the database.

A function is a block of code that performs a particular task. The function has a name and a parameter list. The function also has a function body where the code to perform are mentioned. The function also has a return type. The function has two parts. Function declaration and function calling. A function does not work if the function is never called. A class is a collection of properties and functions. A class has two parts, one has something, that is the properties. One does something, that is the functions.

An array is used to store a collection of data. The data can be of any type. An array can store multiple type of data together and we can access them using the index. The array indexing starts at zero and increments by one. We can store a data of integer type, a data of the string type, a data of boolean type all together in an array. Array has many predefined functions with it that helps us to work efficiently with array.

There are many array functions like array. push which is used to add an element at the end of an array. The array. pop method is used to remove an element from the end of an array. The map function in array is used to create new array of values by calling a function for every array element and it returns a new array. The find method in array returns the first value that passes the test. The filter method in array returns the list of all elements that passes the test.

There are few key concepts in nest.js like modules, controllers, service. Modules are a way to organize and structure the application. The @Module() decorator is used to define a module. Modularity allows us to organize our code, We can reuse the code easily. Whenever we are in the need to use that particular code , we can easily export it and then import it to the particular file and use it. The controllers in nest.js are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and provide response for that HTTP requests.

Controllers use decorators to specify the route path, http method with create, get, put, delete. Services are used by the controllers to perform various operations like processing a data, querying a database. The crud operations are performed in the services. I created note app in nest.js and performed crud operations on it. I have also done validation on my note app. My note app has features like title, description, id, categories, image, pin, lock, archive. I created unique id for each notes using the jetit/Id. 

The validations were like if the title is in any type other than string it throws error stating that the title should be in string. If the description is in any type other than string, it throws error stating that the description should be in the string type. If the categories is not work or personal then throw error that the categories should be either work or personal and you can't enter something else.

I declared entities for typeorm. Entity is a collection of fields and associated database operations. It is used to map database tables and its fields with the entities and attributes. I created a new file and then imported Entity, PrimaryColumn, Column from typeorm. The PrimaryColumn is used to mention what fieldname is my primary key , as primary keys are unique. In my note app I have generated unique id for each notes so the id is my primary key. We can use PrimaryGeneratedColumn if you want the orm to generate its own unique id. In that case we don't have to generate id separately. The Column is used to mention all the other field names. I then imported this class inside the service.

The if statement is used to check whether a condition is satisfied or not. If the condition is satisfied then the block inside the if statement will get executed. If the condition is not satisfied then the if block will never be executed. The if else statement is used for checking whether a condition is true or false. If the condition is true the code inside the if block will get executed. If the condition is not satisfied then the code inside the else block will get executed. The if block can be used without an else block, but an else block can never be used without a if statement.

The else if statement is used in a situation where we want to check multiple condition. First the if statement is checked whether the condition is satisfied or not. If the condition is satisfied the code inside the if statement will get executed. If the condition is not satisfied then the condition inside the else if statement gets checked. If the condition inside the else if statement gets satisfied then the code inside the else if block gets executed. If the condition is not satisfied then the statement inside the else block will get executed.

The switch statement is an alternate for the else if statement as it can also be used to check multiple conditions. The switch statement has an expression and the expression is evaluated only once. After the evaluation multiple cases are given. We can check for the exact case that satisfies the condition and it executes all the code inside that particular case. 

The looping statements in programming languages are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until the condition in the loop becomes false. The looping statement was used to minimize the loop repetition. There are many loops like the for loop, while loop, do while loop and many more. The for loop is used to repeatedly execute the block of code until the condition is false. The for loop has three parts. First the initialization part. Here a variable is assigned with a value. The next part is the looping condition. If the condition is satisfied the loop starts executing. The next part is the increment or decrement expression. Here the variable that was initialized at first will be either incremented or decremented. The loop will be continuously executing until the condition becomes false.

The while loop is similar to the for loop. The while loop is also used to check the condition and iterates the statement repeatedly until the condition becomes false. In the while loop initialization of the variable is before the loop. So first the variable is initialized then the condition is given in the while loop. If the condition is satisfied then it enters inside the while loop and then executes the block of code inside the while loop. The increment or decrement expression is placed inside the while loop. The loop continues until the conditional expression in the while loop becomes false.

The do while loop is another type of looping statement where the condition is checked at the end. Here the variable is initialized at the top. Then it enters inside the loop . After entering the loop all the statements inside the loop gets executed. The variable initialized at the top will be either incremented or decremented inside the loop and finally the condition for the loop will be checked. This loop return one value even if the condition becomes false. The for loop and the while loop are known as the entry controlled loop and the do while loop is known as the exit controlled loop.

Addresses are used to referencing. When you try to assign a value stored in a variable to another variable you are just assigning the same address to the other variable. When you assign a value to a variable a as 10 and then you are assigning a value to a variable b as a then both the variables a and b have the same value because they share the same address. Now if you try changing the value of variable a as 20 and now you try to access both the variables a and b, the value of a will be 20 and the value of b will be 10. This is because the variable a has changed to a new address and the variable b is still on the old address. 

When you assign a value as an array of [1,2,3] to a variable a and then you assign the value of variable a to another variable b.Now both the variable a and b have the same value. Now if I change the value of a as [1,2,3,4] and assign the variable a to variable b, both the variables have the same value [1,2,3,4].

JWT stands for JSON web tokens. The jwt for securely transmitting data between two parties. The jwt has three parts separated by dot. The parts are header, payload, signature. The header contains the metadata about the token like the type of token and the algorithm used. The payload contains the information that is being transmitted. These are generally termed as claims. The signature ensures that the token was not changed along the way. It can verify that the sender of the jwt is who it says it is.

Bcrypt is a cryptographic hashing function for securely hashing and storing the passwords. Bcrypt uses salting method to hash the passwords.Salting means generating random string of characters that combines with the confidential details like the password before hashing. After the process of salting bcrypt performs multiple rounds of hashing. The higher the rounds of hashing means that the password can be more secure. When a user logs in the bcrypt rehashes the password and then compare it with the stored value. If both the values match the user is permitted to log in. If not the permission will be denied.

We also a session about how responsible we all should be. Being responsible should always come from within and we should do whatever we want to do responsibly. If I want to learn something new I should be doing it on my own. I should be learning it because I choose to get more knowledge on it and I should not be doing it just because someone else asked me to do. Whatever we do in life we should be responsible for that and we should take complete ownership of what we are doing. We take care of our parents because we love them. It does not matter whether they take good care of us or not. We will always choose to take good of them. Just like that in our life we should work realy hard and learn new things with interest and learn just because you want to learn.
