Today I got a basic idea about how a password is hashed and how securely it is being saved. We use jwt for securely transmitting data between two parties. JWT stands for JSON web tokens. The jwt has three parts separated by dot. The parts are header, payload, signature. The header contains the metadata about the token like the type of token and the algorithm used. The payload contains the information that is being transmitted. These are generally termed as claims. The signature ensures that the token was not changed along the way. It can verify that the sender of the jwt is who it says it is.

Bcrypt is a cryptographic hashing function for securely hashing and storing the passwords. Unlike other hashing algorithm bcrypt has salt to ensure that the information is transmitted securely. Salting means generating random string of characters that combines with the confidential details like the password before hashing. This is useful when two users have the password the hashed value will be different so we can identify the difference easily.

After the process of salting bcrypt performs multiple rounds of hashing. The higher the rounds of hashing means that the password can be more secure. But the more rounds will be computed slowly. When a user logs in the bcrypt rehashes the password and then compare it with the stored value. If both the values match the user is permitted to log in. If not the permission will be denied.

We recalled about functions and classes. Functions are block of code that are used to execute a particular task. The functions have a name , list of parameters, function body and the return type. The functions have two parts, function declaration and function call. We discussed few problems to find the possible solutions. We also recalled about loops and conditional statements. Conditional statements are the decision making statements. It checks the condition and if the condition is satisfied then it will be executing a block of code.

The if statement is used to check whether a condition is true or not. If it is true then the statements inside the if block gets executed. If the condition is false then the statements will never be executed. The if else statement is used to check whether a condition is true or not. If the condition is true then the if block gets executed. If the condition becomes false then the statement inside the else block will get executed. The else block will not work if there is no if block, but the if block can be on its own. It does not need else block.

The else if statement is used when we want to check more than one condition. First it checks the condition in the if statement. If the condition is true then it executes everything inside the if block. If the condition is false then the statements inside the else-if statements get executed. If neither of the conditions are satisfied then the statements inside the else block gets executed. The switch statement is an alternate for the else if statement. The expression inside the switch is evaluated at once and the corresponding cases gets executed according to the condition given.

The looping statements are used so that we don't have to repeat the statements more than needed. The looping statements checks the condition and execute the block of code inside it until the condition becomes false. The for loop has three parts, the first one is initialization. Here the variable is initialized with a value. The next one is the condition. If the given condition is satisfied then that block of statements inside the for loop gets executed. After the first loop the variable is incremented or decremented. Again that condition is checked and the loop continues until the condition becomes false.

The while loop does not stop the execution until the condition becomes false. The variable is initialized before the loop. Then the condition is checked , if the condition is satisfied then the loop starts executing until the condition becomes false. We can increment or decrement the value of the variable inside the while loop. We also solved problems based on functions, conditional statements and looping statements. We were discussing about all the ways to access the variables inside the function and activities to find the solution for the loops.
