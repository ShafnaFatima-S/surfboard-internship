# Internship Summary

## Day-25 (08/04/25)

### <ins> Key learnings of the day:</ins>

Today we did not have any other session. I tried to set the forgot password page of my note app. I have already designed everything for the forgot password page. I kept validator for checking whether the password and the re- entered password values match. If the values match it allows to submit the form. If the values does not match it should throw error that the passwords are not matching.

I tried many ways to perform that action but I could not do it. Then I used the form group to perform that operation. When I was doing with that I faced many error. To clear the error I googled the error and tried to find the solutions for it. That took so long to find and clearing the error was very hard for me.

After many tries I cleared it and then made the password matching work. I used the ngIf statement in my html. The ngIf statement in angular is used to show a particular statement based on some certain conditions. After making all the changes I created another function. If the validations are done properly then when the button is clicked it should display that the form was submitted successfully in alert. If the validations are not matched then the error message please check the form will be displayed inside the alert. This function works when the user tries to click the create button to submit the forgot password form.
