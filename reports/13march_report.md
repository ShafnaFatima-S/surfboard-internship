# Internship Summary
## Day-10 (13/03/25)
### <ins> Key learnings of the day:</ins>
Today is my 10th day in this internship and today I tried installing pgAdmin and postgreSQL. pgAdmin is a platform for postreSQL databases. PostgreSQL is a open source relational database management system. I have created a server in express.js and created details of an employee using the post method. Then i got the detail of a specific employee using the employee ID by using get method.

I then got the details of all the employees. I also updated the existing details of the employee using put method. Then deleted a specific employee detail using the employee ID by using delete method. If any of the operations failed it generates an error message.

A data can refers to everything. It can be anything like numbers, symbols and many more. Collection of data can be said as a database. Data can be variable or constant. Symbols can be of mathematical operators, >, <, =, (), numbers, alphabets. Tokens can be collection of symbols like hello, 100. Keywords are reserved words like let, var, const, new, for, if. 

Data types are of two types: Primtive data type and complex data type. Primitive data types are the most basic types of data. Integer, boolean, string are primitive data types. Complex data types are derived from the primitive data types. Array, object, maps are complex data types. Variables are the containers for storing data. Programming language has all these keywords, variables, operators, data, terminator. For example, integer a = 10 ; here 'integer' is the keyword, 'a' is the variable, '=' is the assignment operator, '10' is the data and ';' is the terminator.

I tried installing the pgAdmin and postgreSQL but I was unable to do it. I googled all the ways to work with pgAdmin and postgreSQL. I went through some basic queries. These queries allow us to retrieve, update, insert, delete data. We use select query to retrieve data. We use insert query to insert a  data. There are many queries like update, delete and many more. We use clauses like where and from for filtering the data.
