# Internship Summary
## Day-2 (03/03/25)
### <ins> Key learnings of the day:</ins>
Today is my second day in the internship and today I have learned about conjunction, disjunction, negation, implication and biconditional statements. **Conjunction** can be said as a word that connects words or phrases. In logic conjunction refers to the **AND** statement.When both of the conditions are True, then the result will be true or else the result will be False. In logic **Disjunction** refers to the **OR** statement. When both or either of the conditions are true then the result is said to be true or else the result is said to be false. 

**Negation** is said to be the opposite of the truth value. When a statement is true then the negated value will be false. When a statement is false then the negated value will be true. In **Implications**, when both the statements are True then the implication is also True. If the first statement is True and the second statement is False then the implication is False. When the first statement is False then the implication is True no matter what the other statement is. In **Biconditional**, If both the statements are True then the biconditional is True. If the first statement is True and the other statement is False then the biconditional is False. If the first statement is False and the other statement is True then the biconditional is False. If both the statements are False then the biconditional is True.I have also got some knowledge on markdown language and also about array in Javascript.

### <ins>Markdown Language:</ins>
Markdown can be used to create websites, presentations, documents, notes and also in many other work. Markdown is platform independent and it is portable. That means we don't have to worry about accessing it, we can access it from anywhere at any time. Markdown language uses .md extension. We can still use markdown language even when other applications stops working.

### <ins>Array in Javascript:</ins>
Array is a special variable that can hold more than one value. Array index start from 0. There are three keywords in Javascript: let, var, const. Let keyword can be used for re-aassigning and not for re-declaration. Var keyword can be used for re-declaration as well as for re-assigning. Const keyword cannot be used for re-declaration as well as for re-assigning. There are many array methods like array.slice(), array.pop(), array.push(), array.concat() and many more. The array.pop() is used to remove an array element from the last. The array.push() is used to add a new element at the end of an array.

Function is a block of code that executes when it is called. We define javascript function using function keyword, followed by a name and parantheses. Function parameters are listed inside the parantheses. Function arguments are the values received when a function is called.
