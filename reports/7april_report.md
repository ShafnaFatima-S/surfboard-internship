## Day-24 (07/04/25)

### <ins> Key learnings of the day:</ins>

Today I tried to develop the front end design of my note app. I tried to use icons inside the input field. It was a bit difficult for me to find how to apply the properties in angular. So I searched in the web and I referred many websites to come up with the solution. It took so long for me find the correct exact way of integrating icons in angular project.

Somehow I found the way for integrating icons inside the input field. I also designed the front end for forgot password page. I added eye icon on the password field too. I have also added script in that so when I click the eye icon the password will be visible and when I click it again it changes back to the original way.

I have done the architecture for my note app. Using notion I wrote the description about my note app and included the note app architecture. Then I wrote the description of all the functions that I used in the note app. I also started reading the book.

Now I trying to give validity for the forgot password page. I want to check whether the password and re- entered passwords match or not. If the passwords match it should be save in the database. If the passwords does not match then an error message should be thrown in alert.
