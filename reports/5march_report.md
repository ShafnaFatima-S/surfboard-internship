# Internship Summary
## Day-4 (05/03/25)
### <ins> Key learnings of the day:</ins>
Today we had a session about algorithm. Algorithm is the step by step instructions.We had a fun task to write algorithm for, "Go to your bag and get a book ". Algorithm is a step by step instruction so we had to be very precise about the instructions that we give. I really enjoyed working with my team to write an algorithm.

### Conditional Statements:
The conditional statements allows you to execute a particular block of code based on the conditions. The block of code executes only when the condition is satisfied. If the condition is not satisfied then the statements inside the block will  be executed based on any other conditons provided.
- if statement
- if-else statement
- else-if statement
- switch statement
- nested if-else statement

The if statement is used to check whether the given condition is satisfied or not. If the condition is satisfied then the block of code will be executed. The if else statement is used to check whether the given condition is satisfied or not. If the condition is satisfied the block of code inside the if statement gets executed. If the condition is false then the block of code inside the else statement gets executed.

The else if statement can be used to mention another condition if the first condition is false. Here the condition of the if statement is checked , if the condition is satisfied then the block inside the if statement is executed. If the condition inside the if statement is not satisfied then the else if block gets checked. If it satisfies the condition then the block of code inside the else if statement gets executed. If not, the block of code inside the else statement gets executed.

The expression in the switch statement is evaluated once and then the value of the expression is compared with all the test cases. If the value is matched then the block of code inside that case is executed.If the value doesn't match then the statements inside the default case gets executed. In nested if-else statement we can have a if-else statement inside another if or else block.

### Looping Statements:
Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as the condition is true.
- for loop
- while loop
- do-while loop

For loop executes a block of code until the condition becomes false. It has initialization, condition and increment/decrement. At first we should initialize it and then check the condition. If the condition is satisfied then the statements inside the loop will be executed and then the value will be incremented or decremented. Again it checks the condition and the loop goes on until the condition becomes false.

While loop executes a block of code until the condition becomes false.It checks the condition, if the condition is satisfied then the loop will be executed.It continues execution of loop until the condition is true. If it becomes false the loop will be terminated.

The do while loop is an exit controlled loop. The do while loop executes as long as the condition is true. But it executes atleast once before checking the condition. It executes the loop and checks the condition at the last.I have also solved a probelm today. To write a function called fizzBuzz that takes a number n as input and prints numbers from 1 to n with the following rules:

- If a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead.
- If a number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead.
- If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
- Otherwise, print the number itself.
