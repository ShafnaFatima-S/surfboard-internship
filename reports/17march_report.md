Today I started the day by googling the postgreSql queries to create a table amd modify them. The CREATE TABLE query is used to create a table. We specify the field names along with the types. To insert a record use the INSERT INTO query. Insert into the table with the field name and values. To fetch data use the SELECT query. We can fetch all the data or specific columns from the table. To update a table use the UPDATE query. To add a column use the ALTER TABLE query.

I tried installing postgreSQL but couldn't do it at all. After a while I was able to clear the errors and install postgreSQL. I created a server and I was able to apply validity to it. For example, The age field should only be a number and not any character. The phone number should contain 10 digits. Anything more than or less than 10 digit will throw error. The mail entered should be a valid mail format. The blood group entered should be a valid blood group. Any other invalid blood group will throw error. And finally I have made a condition to check for the phone number whenever a new request has been sent , so that I can find the duplicate and prevent it from entering. That is, preventing duplicate entry.

A function is a block of code to perform specific task. A function generally has two parts: function declaration and function calling. A function has name, a return type, a function body and then function call. A class can be said as a blueprint and the objects are the way to access the elements of the class. Class has two components : has something , does something. Consider a class Dog. It has name, age,cost. To access these we use object. The constructor has the same name as the class name. We assign values inside the constructor using the this keyword. The functions inside the class is the way to make it do something. We can access the functions inside the class by using the object. 

Nest.js is a framework for building efficient, scalable server side and client side applications.It is built with Typescript but we can also use javascript. It uses express.js for high performance. Typescript is a superset of javascript that adds static types many other features to improve the development experience, reduce errors. It is developed by Microsoft. Typescript compiles down to javascript so it can be run anywhere javascript can run. The basic data types are string, number, boolean, null. 

Even if nest.js supports javascript, typescript is the default, ensuring the type safety. Nest.js encourages the use of modules to organize the application effectively. I installed nest.js using " npm i -g @nestjs/cli " this command. To create a new project use the " nest new project-name " command. The difference between node.js and nest.js is that node.js uses javascript and nest.js uses typescript. Node.js is unstructured and manually managed while nest.js is structured and modular. Node.js does routing manually using express or http modules. Nest.js uses controller, decorators for routing.
