Today I googled about node js. Node js is a javascript runtime environment to create web applications and server side script.Node js uses google's v8 engine. The v8 engine was originally designed for chrome. Safari uses webkit as its engine.To install npm use " npm install -g npm ". To install node js use "npm i node ". To check for the version of node use " node -v ". To check for the version of npm use " npm -v ". Node module is said to be any javascript file. We use module so that we can reuse the code easily instead of writing it all from first.We use require() method to import a module to our javascript file.

Server is a computer or device that takes the requests from the client and give back the response for that request to the client. Client is the one that sends request to the server and wait for the response. Web hosting is a service that provides place to store and access files online. The web hosting platforms are GoDaddy, Hostinger, DreamHost, HostGator and many more.

Port is a virtual connection point that identifies a network's beginning and end.The array.fill() method is used to replace all the elements of an array with the specified value. I also understood about crud. CRUD means to perform operations like creation, reading, updating and deletion. We can create by creating a object constructor and by creating object literals. We can perform read operation by destructuring assignment, dot notation and square brackets. We perform update operation by dot notation and square brackets. We can perform deletion operation by a delete operator and destructuring assignment.

I also solved a problem to replace few character in a morse code. First I stored the strings to be replaced in a variable. Then I had to split the morse code using split() method and store it in a variable. Then using map() method I checked each element and converted it to string and then by using replace() method I replaced every string that are needed to be replaced. Then by using join() method I joined everything together and stored it in a variable. Then I returned the variable. I also wrote an algorithm for another problem. An algorithm to sort 5000 degree certificates in reverse alphabetical order.

I also got some knowledge on how to create a server using node js. There are two ways to create a server using node js. The first way is by using built-in http module. By using http.createServer() we can listen for the request from the client and then send response according to the request. The res.write() method is used to send some information to the client and the res.end() method is used for concluding. The server.listen() method is used for indicating that the server runs on the particular port.

The second way is by using express module. Install the express module and then create server using that. Import the express module using require() method. The app.use() method allows you to define functions that run before handling requests. The res.send() method is used for sending response to the client by the server. The app.get() method listens for a request at specific url path and executes a callback function when that path is accessed.
