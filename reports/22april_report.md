## Day-32 (22/04/25)
### <ins> Key learnings of the day:</ins>
Today we had a session where we discussed about potential. A potential can vary from person to person and each one of us will have potential in some context. Identifying what potential I have and in what context I am using my potential is important. One might be an achiever in a context and if that person changes the context to someother it will be difficult for that person to achieve in that context also. When a person is at the end of his life, his potential must be used as much as possible. If the potential of a person stays as same as it was in the past then the person did nothing with it. 

Our potential should be used as we grow older and the realization of our potential must be increasing as we grow older. We should be using our potential as much as possible. At the same time using our potential in the correct context is very important. There are four factors that will help us analyse our potential. They are intrinsic, extrinsic, changeable, unchangable. If a person is in the extrinsic and unchangeable nature it will help them attain whatever they need to do. For using the full potential one should have all the other three combinations. They should be intrinsic and changeable, extrinsic and changeable, intrinsic and unchangeable.  

There are some factors that will help us understand what we need in a job. money, security and status, work environment, purpose and challenges, work life balance. Being a beginner one should always see the purpose and challenges of a job. How well that person can use his or her potential in that and how they overcome the challenges that is very important. Other factors should not affect it for now because over the time one can do well in the job and does not have to completely giveup anything to do the job.

Later I did some changes in my note app. When I was working with insomnia I had some issues with two endpoints. I cleared the problem which I had to change the request type. Then I saved the notes using the note app. I had created a note component when the user creates a note it will directly be saved in the database and it will not save in the database if there is any error in the format of data. Then I took the icons like trash, pin and archive and made it visible when the user hovers the notes listed. Now I am working with taking the id of a particular element or note and then assigning it to the icons so that the functions like archive, pin and trash can work.
