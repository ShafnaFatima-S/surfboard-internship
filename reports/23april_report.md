Today we had a session about firebase. Firebase is a platform that provides tools to help developers build and manage web and mobile applications quickly and efficiently. There are many features in firebase that help us understand more about the app and the app usage. Firebase analytics is one of the tools that help us understand how users interact with your application. Firebase collects information automatically and help us to track the usage of the app. We can view how many people are using this app, from which countries people are using, how many new users logged in. how many times a user logged in. We can get all these kinds of information from firebase analytics.

Firebase provides realtime databases and firestore database. The realtime database is a noSQL database that stores all the data in a json format. In a single json file all the data are stored and any changes that you make in the json data will automatically be assigned to all the places where you use the data. In firestore database the data are stored in the form of documents and then these documents are grouped into collections. You can store any types of data inside the document. It can be of string, array, object, number. Firebase hosting is a fast and easy way to host your web applications. We can also host simple html, css, javascript files in firebase hosting. It also uses us to host web applications that uses frameworks like angular, react and many more. I tried to host a demo project in firebase. First I logged inside firebase and then created a new project. In terminal I installed firebase. After giving all the needed details I deployed my project using the firebase deploy --only hosting command.

Later I did some changes in my note app. I made the archive and trash icons to be visible if the mouse hovers over the notes. I wrote functions in way that if a user click the archive icon then the note will be archived . While clicking the note id of that particular note will be taken and the archive function is called. When the user clicks on the trash icon the note will be deleted. For that I wrote function in a way that the note id of the particular note will be chosen and then the trash function will be triggered by passing the id value. So when the user clicks on the icon that particular note will be deleted and moves to the last 30 days deleted list. When I clicked the archived notes button all the archived notes will be displayed. For that I wrote a function to get all the archived notes that are available and displayed it in the notes.
