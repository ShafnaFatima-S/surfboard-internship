The array.reduce() method is used to iterate over an array. It applies a reducer function to each element of an array, accumulating a single output value. It takes initial value and process it from left to right reducing the array to a single output value. The array.reverse() method is used to reverse the order of an array. It does not have any parameters. The reverse method directly modifies the original array by reversing its elements.

I have also known about the difference between http and https. Hypertext transfer protocol is a protocol which we use to transfer the hypertext throughout the web. Http is the most widely used protocol for data transfer over the internet, but the data exchanged using http is not secure. The data exchanged through http goes as a plain text so anyone between the browser and server can view it. This can also lead to stealing of data. To solve this issue we use https, which is the extended version of http with a secure communication.

In https, the communication protocol is encrypted using transport layer security. The HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure.The HTTPS can be defined as a secure variant of the HTTP protocol. Data can be transferred using this protocol in an encrypted format. It shields your website from data phishing.

A network is a group of connected computers that are able to send data to each other. The Internet is a vast collection of networks that connect to each other. The internet makes it possible to rapidly exchange information from one computer to another across the world. All data sent over the internet is translated into pulses of light or electricity called bits and then interpreted by the receiving computer. The more bits that can pass over these wires at once, the faster the internet works.

I also solved a problem where I have to check a number for its validity. I took a 12 digit number and then used split() method on it. Then I removed the last digit using pop() method. Using the array.reverse() method I reversed the array. Using the map() function I multiplied each element of the array by 2. Then I used a callback function to add the products of the array together. I continued to add the result until I get a single digit. To add again, I used JSON.stringify() method to convert the result into a string and then again used split() method to split it and make it into an array. If the result is equal to the element I removed at first, it prints that the number is valid. If the result is not equal to the element I removed at first, then it prints that the number is not valid.
