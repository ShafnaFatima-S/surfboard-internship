## Day-9 (12/03/25)
### <ins> Key learnings of the day:</ins>
Today I started my day with the installation process of node.js and created a server using express.js. I also installed insomnia for sending request to the server. I used many methods like app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), app.delete() for handling different types of requests. The  express.js is a web framework for node.js. It helps in creating server side API. The method app.get() is used for fetching data from the server. The method app.post() is used for creating new records and sending it to server. The app.put() method is used for updating data on a server. The app.delete() method is used for removing data from the server.

The spread operator is represented by three dots. The spread operator is used for expanding elements of arrays, objects. The body-parser is used for parsing the incoming request before handling them. The throw new error is used to manually trigger error in js. I also had to work with html, css and javascript.
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML is used to create and structure web pages. There are various tags to create a webpage. The basic tags are < html >, < head >, < title >, < body >. The head tag contains all the metadata. Metadata provides descriptive information about a webpage. The title tag is used for giving a title for our webpage.

The body tag contains all the visible contents of the webpage. The h1 tag to h6 tags are used for heading. h1 is the largest and h6 is the smallest. The p tag is used for paragraph. The br tag is used for breaking a line and it is a self closing tag. The b tag is used for bold text and i tag is used for italic text. The u tag is used for underlining a text. The hr tag is used for a horizontal line. There are few list elements like : The ul tag is used for unordered list represented using bullet points. The ol tag is used for ordered list represented using numbers. The li tag is used inside the ul and ol tags.

The a tag is used for creating a hyperlink. The img tag is used for displaying an image on the webpage. The table tag is used for creating table. The tr tag is used for creating table row and td tag is used for creating table data cell. The th tag is used for creating table header cell. There are many other tags as well to enhance the webpage. The form tag is used for creating a form in the webpage which has many input types. We can integrate javascript in our html page using the script tag.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. We use css in our webpage to enhance the view of out webpage. Basically we can style our webpage using css. There are three ways to apply css: Internal CSS, External CSS, Inline CSS. Internal css is applied by giving the styles inside the style tag, which is inside the head tag. External css is applied by having a separate css file and then integrating that file with the html file using link tag. Inline css is applied inside the specific tags itself. We use javascript in our webpage to make the webpage more interactive and responsive. We can apply events on the button and then have js code written to do a specific task.
