### <ins> Key learnings of the day:</ins>
Today I did crud operations to get all the notes from my note app, get the specific note by using the unique id generated. I also did update operation by getting the id and then checking if that id exists. Then after checking I found the index of that id and spliced it. Later used a spread operator and stored it a variable and then pushed that variable inside the array of notes. I also performed delete operation by using the id. Found the index of the id and spliced it.

Later I connected my note app to the database. I imported the typeorm module and gave all the essential details like the username, password, type, host, port, database, synchronize, entities. The type defines what kind of database we are connecting to. The host refers to where the database is located. For now the host is the localhost as I am running the application and the database in the same machine.

The port refers to the port number that we are using to connect to the database. The username refers to the username to authenticate the connection to the database. The password refers to the specific password for the username field. The synchronize tells the typeorm to automatically synchronize the database schema with the models. The entities represents the table in the database. Using the crud operation I created it to send the data that came from the user to the database and now i'm working to get all the notes from the database.

We then had a quick session where we recalled about functions and classes. Functions are a block of code that is used to perform a particular task. A function has a name and parameter list. It has a body and the return type for the result. A class is a collection of properties and function. A class has two parts : which has something that is, properties and which does something that is, the functions.

An array is used to stored a collection of data. The data stored in the array can be of any type. It stores multiple types of data together and we can access the array using the index of the array. The array indexing starts with 0 and increments by one . An array can hold a data of the number type, a data of the string type , a data of the boolean type all together in one place. Array has many predefined functions which helps us to work with arrays efficiently.

An object is also used to store data but it uses key value pair. We access the object with the key. It can also be an array because the array has index to access it and the object has the key to access it. Conditional statements in programming languages are used to perform operations only if the condition given is satisfied. Conditional statements are used for making decisions. The conditional statements have if, else, else-if, switch and so on. The if statement is used to check whether the given condition is satisfied. If the condition is satisfied the block of code inside the if statement gets executed. If not that statements will not be executed.

The else block is used after the if block. If the condition inside the if block fails the block of code inside the else block gets executed. The if block can be used without the else block but the else block cannot be used without the if block. The else-if statement is used in a situation where we need to check multiple conditions. Each conditions are checked until a condition is satisfied. If neither of the conditions were satisfied the else block gets executed. 

The looping statements in the programming language helps you to repeatedly execute a block of code based on the condition or the number of iterations. There are many loops like the for loop, while loop, do-while loop and so on. The for loop has three parts. The initialization, condition to be checked, update expression. The variable is initialized at first then the condition is checked. If the condition is satisfied it enters inside the block and executes the statement. Once it is executed the value is incremented. Then again it checks for the condition and the loop continues until the condition becomes false.

The while loop is also similar to for loop but the difference is the initialization part is before the while loop. Then it checks the condition in the while loop and execute the block if it is true. Then the update expression is given inside the while block. The do-while loop executes the block first and then checks for the condition. It is known as the exit controlled loop.
