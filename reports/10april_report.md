# Internship Summary
## Day-27 (10/04/25)
### <ins> Key learnings of the day:</ins>
Today we discussed about the static, const and final keyword. The static keyword that is declared inside a class remains unchanged throughout the class. We generally don't have to create object for accessing those static variables because as they remain unchanged we can access it directly. So we don't need an object for accessing a static variable. The const keyword is used when the value is constant everywhere we cannot change it. The final keyword can be given a value only once after that we cannot change the value at all.

We also discussed about inheritance. Inheritance is accessing the properties of a parent class. The child class can inherit the properties of the parent class and can use those properties inside the child class. The child class inherits the properties by using the extends keyword.

Yesterday I was trying to make the elements that I stored in the array to be displayed in my UI. I have created a div and gave css for the inner div. When I changed the styling from inner div to outer div I was able to get each array elements in different div boxes.

Then I applied the concept of flex to make it align equallly.Then I tried to do api calls from front end to back end but I there was some error in that which made it hard for me to make api calls. I am trying to clear the error right now. I tried googling for solving the error and tried many ways. I am currently reading a docs for solving that particular error. The error was called CORS error. I enabled that in my backend as mentioned in the docs but still the error is there. Hopefully I will clear the error soon.
