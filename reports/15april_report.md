# Internship Summary
## Day-30 (15/04/25)
### <ins> Key learnings of the day:</ins>
Today we had a session about mobile app development. It was an interesting session where I had learned many new things. Before developing a complete product the developers publish a MVP. MVP stands for minimum viable product. This means it is a small version of the product with the features. The developers publish this version and then take feedbacks and suggestions from the user. This will help the developer to get more idea about how the user needs the products and what are the changes he or she can make to satisfy the needs of the user.

We then discussed about wireframing. Wireframing can be said as the skeleton of the app. It gives a basic structure about the webpage. We don't have to mention the text or colors in them, it gives the basic structure of the webpage. For wireframing we use the tool called figma or else we can just note it down with pen and paper. We then saw about native and cross platform. Native means building an app for a specific platform. It can be either android or ios. Native gives the best performance. Cross platform means building an app that works in different platform. It can work in both ios and android. Cross platform gives faster development as you don't have to do separate coding for each platform and it is easier to maintain.

We then saw about flutter. Flutter is a cross platform app development framework. Everything in a flutter is a widget. Text, button, logo, container everything here is a widget. Then we saw about hot reload and hot restart. Hot reload means any changes that you make in your app can be instantly updated in the running code. Hot restart means any changes that you make in your app will make the app to be rebuild again. The app gets rebuild everytime you make a change. There are two types of compilation modes. Just in time compilation and Ahead of time compilation.

The just in time compilation works when the code is compiled when the app is running. The just in time compilation is used during the development phase of an app. It is used in debug mode because it make hot reload possible and gives faster development. The ahead of time compilation is used during release mode. The ahead of time compilation takes a long time compared to the just in time compilation. As I mentioned above everything in flutter is a widget. When you put a widget inside a widget they form a tree structure. Basically it can be a material app which contains scaffold. The scaffold contains the app bar and body which is used to organize the page structure. Then it contains columns, text, buttons.

The flutter architecture has three layers. They are framework, engine and embedder. There are three build types in flutter. The dev mode, profile and production. The dev mode is the phase when the app is in the development. The profile is when the developed app is in testing. Usually the dev is not given for testing because it has many logs which are used for debugging purpose and the size of the file will be very large. The testing is done in profile which has a very few number of logs. The production is when the app is ready for publishing in playstore or app store. It has a no logs in this and the size of the file will be smaller and has a faster performance.

There are many testing methods like manual testing, unit testing, automated testing, widget testing. Manual testing is when you open the app on a device and test it yourself. Automated testing is when the whole app is tested by running it in a device. Unit testing means testing a small section of the app. The lifecyle of app can be said to start from wireframing, designing, developing, testing, publishing and after publishing getting the feebdack of the user and modify any updates.
