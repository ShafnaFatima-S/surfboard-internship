## Day-15 (24/03/25)
### <ins> Key learnings of the day:</ins>
Today I created a new project for making authentication for the note app that I have already created. I created the new project using the command " nest new project-name ". By doing this we can install all the nest.js packages inside another folder easily. Then I made database connection with postgreSQL database and with typeorm. 

The typeorm is written in typescript so it works very well with the nest.js frameworks. I imported the typeorm module and made the database connections. I gave all the needed details like the type, database, port, synchronize, host, username, password and entities. The type is given as postgres, the port number is given as 5432, the host is given as localhost, the username is given as postgres, the database is given as postgres. The entities are given as auth_App.

The entities in auth_App is given in a way that the id of string type will be the primary column. The username of string type is given in a column. The password of string type is given in a column. The column name delete is of the type boolean and the default value given to it is false. The column name deletedAt belongs to date type and returns the date and time whenever a record is deleted. By default the value will be null. The column name createdAt belongs to the date type and it returns the date and time whenever a new record is created. The interface file has two fields. The username and the password . Both the username and the password are of the string type.

I then created a service to get the username and password from the user. I have given two constraints while getting the username and password from the user. The first one is that the username that I am getting from the user should be a string type. Anything other than a string will not be allowed to use as a username and it throws error that the username should be a string. The second one is that the password that I am getting from the user should also be a string type. Anything other than the string type will not be used as a password and it throws error that the password should be a string.

I generated a random id in the string type by installing and importing  the jetit/id package. I stored the generated the random string and stored it in the id. I got the username and the password from the user. Then I declared saltrounds as 10. The more the salt rounds are the more secure the password will be. Then I hashed the password using bcrypt. I used bcrypt.hash() function to hash the password into a sequence of strings. The hash() method takes two arguments, one argument is the password and the other argument is the saltrounds.

I then stored all the details like the generated id, username and the hashed password inside the database. I created another service to delete the records from the database by using the generated id. First I used the findOne() function to get the details from the database by using the given id. Now the actual task is not to delete the record from the database but to mention that the data is deleted without actually deleting it. When I try to delete the record using the id the delete field will change from false to true and then the deletedAt field will return the deleted date and time.

I also have to create few more services which I am still trying to do. Currently I am trying to get the password from the user and then compare it with the stored password. If the password given by the user and the hashed password matches then a success message will be given. If the passwords does not match an error message will be thrown.
