### <ins> Key learnings of the day:</ins>
Today we had a session about how we should interact with ai efficiently. We also got some knowledge on the prompting techniques. Every ai model have some limitations for programming. Tokens are the unit of  words that the ai model will easily understand. Every ai model will take the paragraphs that we send and convert it into tokens. For example the sentence " hello world " will have two tokens. The two tokens are hello and world. The ai model will convert the sentences into tokens so that they can understand everything easily and provide us with matching results. 

Generally if we interact with an ai model for a long time it tends to forget the old memories. The prompting patterns are the effective way to interact with ai models. To get more detailed and accurate details we should use the prompting methods. Some prompting methods are chain of thought, few shot learning, zero shot learning and many more. In chain of thoughts prompting technique we should the detailed step by step instruction. In the few shot learning prompting technique we should provide some examples so that it can follow that and give us what we need.In zero shot learning prompting technique we can directly ask for the solution without giving any examples. The ai model will provide us with the solution through pre-training.

When you are asking an ai model to give you a website that works very well we should first write down all the essential functions in a separate markdown file. The markdown file should contain information about how your websites front end is going to be and what are the unique functions that you are going to declare. Give a list of design ideas at first. Then note down all the functions. Give details on what type of language you are going to use for backend, what framework you want to use. List down all the needed details on the markdown file. You can praise the ai model and ask politely to it so that you can get a better response.

The memory banks refers to the duration of memory that each conversations hold. The GPTs have a short term memory as it can just remember about the current conversation and not about any other previous conversations. The GPTs will have limitations so give all the details accurately one after the other in a markdown file rather than giving it in a big paragraph which it takes more time to process and it will not give accurate solution.

I also tried to design the note app using angular. I am currently designing to display all the notes. I used the decorator @font-face to import external fonts. I took the fonts from google fonts and imported it in the css of the page. I have designed the login page and sign-up page and gave routing for that. Now I am trying to use svg icon inside the input field, I tried using the background image property but it shows error so I should find some other way to import the icon.
