### <ins> Key learnings of the day:</ins>
Today recalled about the scope of a variable and the execution stack. The scope of a variable shows where we can access a variable inside a program. The main function is the first one to be executed in a program. Consider a program in which variables are assigned. Inside the main function another function is used. Inside that function we are trying to access the variables that are declared in the main function. This actually works and it allows the function to access the variables of the main function.

If another variable is declared inside the sub function and we are trying to access that variable outside the function then it will be undefined. The execution stack will help any programming languages to check what blocks gets executed and the accessibility of the variable. The execution stack also helps us to find out the scope of the variable. We also discussed about synchronous way of programming. We didn't have a detailed discussion on it, just the introduction to it. Synchronous code executes sequentially. It waits until all the work is done and then moves to the next work. whereas asynchronous code executes multiple tasks at a time.

I wrote separate functions in my note app so that a user can pin a note. A user can pin only 5 notes, if a user is trying to pin more note it will throw error. When all the notes are displayed the pinned notes will be in the top. I also wrote functions for lock and archive as well. If the user is trying to lock a note for the first time, a password should be given. When the user is trying to access that note the password should be given. When all the notes are displayed the locked note will not be visible.

If the user is archiving a note and then trying the access the list of all notes the archived note will not be displayed. If the user wants to display the archived note they can access it by using the id. Here I got the login details using header. If the token is valid then the archived note will be displayed by using the id. If not it will throw an error message that the token is invalid.

Even for the lock I did the same thing. I got the login details as token in the header. Then I verified the token whether it is valid or not. If the token is valid the lock operation will be done. If the tokens are not valid then it will throw error that the token is invalid. The same was done for the pin as well. The limit for the number of pins per user is given as 5. I am going to try the front end of the note app using html and css.
