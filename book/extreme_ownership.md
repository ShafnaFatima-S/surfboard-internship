## Part I : Winning The War Within
In the first chapter the author tells about the war zone in Ramadi, Iraq. Here a friendly iraqi soldier was mistakenly killed during the fight. He was not killed wantedly , he was killed because of some misunderstanding and miscommunication among the soldiers. There was a meeting to discuss about the problem that had happened and they investigated everyone in the room. To find who did the mistake they investigated everyone in the room. Each of them took blame on themselves that they did not do their work properly but jocko blamed himself for what had happened and said that it was his mistake as he did not give proper guide to the other soldiers in the team. This shows how a leader should be . We should not put blame on others and let them get the punishment. If it is a team work the leader takes the full responsibility of everything whether it goes wrong or right the leader takes all the responsibility. Jocko says that he did not communicate well with the team so it was his mistake for the kill that had happened. When we work as a team it should not consider one's ego. Its about the team winning and not the personal ego. If you are doing a business and it is in a downfall then do not blame the employees or any others, first ask yourself whether you have explained to them clearly. whether each of them understood what was going on and what they have to do.

In the next chapter the author shares about the hell week in SEAL. During this period in the navy it will be very difficult to go through all the challenges. The soldiers had to perform a race, the last one in the race will be punished badly by giving difficult tasks like carrying the boat over the head and running. The seal soldiers were split into a group of six. Each group had a leader who is going to assist the other members of the team and win the race. The seal soldiers were terrified of the hell week. Just like the name it will be very difficult for the seal soldiers. The race began and all the seal teams were participating well. This race happened for many time but each time a same team lost the race and another team won the race. The commander noticed that and tried to check whether this happened because of the leader or not. This experience showed us that how important it is to be a good leader. The commander asked the leader of the winning team to swap the team with the losing team. Both the leaders were hesitant but they did what the commander asked the leaders to do. The winning team leader was very hesitant but he believed in himself and took the challenge in hand. The losing team leader was overconfident that he can lead the other team and win and the reason his previous team lost was not because of him. He thinks that it was the team members fault and not his. When the race began everyone was eagerly waiting to know who won and who lost. After a while the boat crew with the good leader won the race again. Even if the team was swapped he still managed to win the race with his new team. This shows that there are no bad teams and only bad leaders. A good leader will be with the team members and share all the hardships and success together with the team. A leader can change the fate of the team whether to win and attain the goal or to lose everything.

In the next chapter the author tells us how confident we should be in the decision we make. Whatever you do you should believe on yourself. If you don't believe in you then your team will also not believe you. If you don't believe in your decisions and ideas then your team will also not believe in that. In a war zone the author doubted the mission they were going to do which was given to him by the higher officials. He did not understand why they had to do that and it really meant pointless to him. As he felt that way his team members also felt in the same way and doubted why they had to it. Later the author made it clear by understanding completely why they had to do that and what is the purpose of it. First the author thought it was a waste of time but now he knew the value of the mission. Now that he know the value of the mission he says everything to his team members and explains everything to them clearly. Now the team members also understood the value for that. This is why you should believe in whatever you do. If you think that the decision or plan is correct then you have the ability to make your team members to understand that and believe in it.

In the next chapter the authors shares about the ego and how the ego can affect the whole team. The author tells how the ego can affect a mission in war zone. Each commanders and team leaders will think that only they know everything and whatever they do is correct. They will not share anything with other members. This can cause a big impact on the mission because the ego will not let them communicate with others and it will lead to misunderstanding and confusion among the soldiers. Even if you are wrong ego will make you think as if whatever you do is correct. With the ego one will not be able to accept whatever suggestions or feedback he gets. In business one said the author about some miscommunication that was happening there because each had their ego and could not completely share the thoughts and views on the plan. So the author suggested to set aside the ego and share or clearly explain the plan to the other person. The man then did the thing as the author said and he managed to solve that issue just by setting aside the ego. This is how a leader should be. A leader should not carry an ego with him that he know everything and whatever he does is right. A leader must listen to others thoughts and accept it and then implement the plan if it suits well enough. 
## Part II : Laws Of Combat
In this chapter the author tells the importance of being there for the team and how working as a team is very important. Cover and move is the basic thing in the battle field. One team should cover for the other team so that they can fight against the terrorist in a good manner. The author was a part of the sniper overwatch in Ramadi, Iraq. There were two teams who was doing their mission in Ramadi. After completing the mission they had to come back to the base. Ramadi was not a peaceful place. No one knew what was going to happen at any moment. They all had to be very prepared about what was going to happen. When returning from the mission they all had to be very careful. Each team came to the seal base by their own way. They did not come so easily. They had to be very safe to reach the seal base. After reaching the seal base the author was asked what was he doing by his higher official. He said him that they should have reached the seal base by using the other team as the cover for them. They should not have taken so much of risk. At that time the author realized what his higher official have said and regretted for not using the other team as the cover for them. He realized that how important it was for the team to work together. It would have been way more easier and safer if they asked the other team to cover for them but instead they chose a risky path. Team work is very much important in everything. One should understand the view of each team members. Working as a team can make tough things look easier.
